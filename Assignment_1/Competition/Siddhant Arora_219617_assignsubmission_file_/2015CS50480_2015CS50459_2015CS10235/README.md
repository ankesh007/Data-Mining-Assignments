# Frequent-Itemset-Mining
Data Mining Assignment 1
Team Members are Siddhant Arora, Madhur Singhal and Makkunda Sharma.

Explanation for Q2:
We see that for both Apriori and FP Tree time decreases as we increase min support as the items that need to be considered for for generating candidate sets of size 2 fall down dramatically. 

In FP Tree, we observe that for large value of X, most of time actually accounts to construction of FP Tree and execution time remains more or less similar.
